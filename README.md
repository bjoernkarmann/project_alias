Project Alias is an open-source parasite to train custom wake-up names for smart home devices while disturbing their built-in microphone. Read more about the project [here](http://bjoernkarmann.dk/project_alias).

<p style='color:red'>NOTE: this project is experimental and still in development.</p>


## Build Guide


For the complete step-by-step guide and 3D files see our [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Project-Alias).


## Raspberry Pi Setup üîß

How to prepare and setup a Raspberry Pi for this project:

1. Using the [SD Memory Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/index.html "SD's Download Page"), reformat your memory card by selecting the `overwrite` option and following the prompts.

2. Download the **2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch.img** image of [Raspbian](https://howchoo.com/g/nzc0yjzjy2u/raspbian-stretch-download) and flash your micro SD card with [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

3. Copy the **ssh**, **wpa_supplicant.conf**, **tensorboard-1.12.0-py3-none-any.whl**, **tensorflow-1.14.0-cp35-none-linux_armv7l.whl**, and **scipy-1.3.3-cp35-cp35m-linux_armv7l.whl** files from the [setup folder](setup/) to the SD card (boot).


4. Edit the **wpa_supplicant.conf** in a text editor to match your wifi settings. Insert the card to the raspberry pi


5. In terminal ssh into the pi: ```sudo ssh pi@raspberrypi.local```<br>*Default password is 'raspberry'. To change password use the 'passwd' command*

6. Update the pi: ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade```<br>

7. Reboot ```sudo reboot```


## Installing 

On the Rapsberry Pi: clone and install the sound driver for the ReSpeaker hat:
This is only required when using the ReSpeaker hat, this code will also work with other sound drivers.
```
cd && git clone https://github.com/respeaker/seeed-voicecard.git
cd seeed-voicecard && sudo ./install.sh
```

Install the required modules in the following order:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip git libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-spidev python-h5py
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio libsdl-ttf2.0-0 python3-pygame
sudo pip3 install --no-cache-dir protobuf
sudo pip3 install flask flask_socketio python_speech_features
```

Clone the **Alias** project:
```
git clone --single-branch --branch 1.0 https://github.com/bjoernkarmann/project_alias.git
```

Install packages from the wheels from the **installation** directory.
```
cd project_alias/installation
sudo pip3 install tensorboard-1.12.0-py3-none-any.whl
sudo pip3 install scipy-1.3.3-cp35-cp35m-linux_armv7l.whl
cd
```

Install **tensorflow** and **keras**:
```
sudo pip3 install --no-cache-dir https://www.piwheels.org/simple/tensorflow/tensorflow-1.14.0-cp35-none-linux_armv7l.whl#sha256=cba22b6d9a3e7a92c07e142bd5256c9773fd20c18090cb1d222357d3b3028655
sudo pip3 install keras
```

Create **startup.sh** and open it:
```
touch startup.sh
sudo nano startup.sh
```

Fill **startup.sh** with the following:
```
#!/bin/sh

cd /home/pi/project_alias

python3 app.py &

exit 0
```

Open your bootscript:
```
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

and add the following command immediately before the line that conatins **exit 0**:
```
sudo /home/pi/startup.sh
```

Update permissions for the bootscript.
```
sudo chmod 755 project_alias/app.py
sudo chmod 755 startup.sh
sudo cdmod 755 /etc/rc.local
```

Reboot the RPi to test it:
```
sudo reboot
```

Requirements files are provided in the `installation` directory in the **apt-reqs.txt** and **pip-reqs.txt** files.



## Training Alias üçÑ



1. To train Alias use the browser on your phone and open ```raspberrypi.local:5050```

2. Hold down the record button while saying the new name about 4-6 times. A small bar should indicate the 2 seconds recording window. Each name should fit within this timeframe.

3. Under the menu, click **Train Alias** and wait a few seconds for the model to learn the name. This name does not necessarily need to be a word but can be a sound and any language. So be creative! You can always reset your name on the menu. *Tip: it helps to record the name from different locations in your home.*

4. Try it out! Say the name and ask your question once you see a blue light on the device or on your phone. 
Note: once trained there is no need to have the phone connected anymore. 

*If you find Alias is not responding correctly, try to train a few more examples. Or if you find Alias is triggering to often, you can go to the menu and turn background sound ON. This toggles the background mode and adds any new recordings to the background examples. Record and train just as before, but try to capture unique sounds in your environment or even words that sound similar to your chosen name.*

## Calibration 

- If you are using a **Amazon Alexa**, please change line 21 in **app.py** to: ```wakeup = sound.audioPlayer("data/alexa.wav",0,"wakeup", False)```

- To set the volume of the speaker you can change the line 32 in **modules/sound.py** ```os.system('sudo amixer -c 1 sset Speaker 83')```
